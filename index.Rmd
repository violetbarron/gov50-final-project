## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the vast disparities between various Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI) ethnic subgroups in the United States. I plan to use publicly available U.S. Census Data (found at data.census.gov) to explore a multitude of variables, such as educational attainment, median household income, poverty rates, English proficiency, citizenship and immigration status, and so on. Through this project, I hope to disprove the reductionist view of the AANHPI community as a wealthy and well-educated monolith.
