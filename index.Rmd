## Introduction

Does having a family which provides educational support affect students' grades? In this study, I plan to examine the extent to which family educational support contributes to student performance.

I hypothesize that students whose families are able to provide educational support will earn higher grades, while students whose families aren't able to provide educational support will earn lower grades.

This data — and my analysis of it — is important because determining the factors that may lead to discrepancies in students' grades can provide schools with ideas of how to fill in the gaps in students' academic experiences. For example, if my hypothesis is proven correct and students whose families provide them with educational support indeed perform better academically than students whose families do not provide them with educational support, schools can use this data to provide the latter subset of students with additional institutional educational support.

## Data

My data is sourced from a survey that measures student performance (determined by final grades) and the various aspects of student identity (e.g. family sie, parents' career, number of hours spent studying per week, etc.) in two Portuguese secondary schools, Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira. I found the dataset on kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set), but it was originally retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance, and its original source is Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, GuimarÃ£es, Portugal (http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez).

This research design is cross-sectional, as it was not generated from a randomized experiment, nor does it measure any sort of change over time or differences-in-differences. The explanatory, or independent, variable is whether students receive educational support from their families or not. The variable is coded =1 for family educational support and =0 for no family educational support. The outcome, or dependent, variable is a student's final grade. This variable is measured on a scale of 0-20, with 0 being the lowest possible final grade and 20 being the highest possible final grade a student could receive. As I mentioned above, the independent and dependent variables were both measured via a survey conducted in 2008 which measures student performance and various aspects of student identity in two Portuguese secondary schools.

If I observe that students who receive educational support from their families earn, on average, higher final grades, this would provide support for my hypothesis. If, on the other hand, I observe that students who receive educational support from their families earn, on average, lower final grades, this would provide evidence against my hypothesis. When I run my regression of students' average final grades on the family educational support indicator variable, a positive, relatively significant coefficient would indicate support for my hypothesis.

## Results

Average Final Grade by Commute Time

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble <- studentperformance |>
  group_by(traveltime) |>
  summarize(mean_finalgrades = mean(G3)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = traveltime,
              values_from = mean_finalgrades)

knitr::kable(tibble,
  col.names = c("< 15 min", "15-30 min", "30 min-60 min", "> 60 min"))
